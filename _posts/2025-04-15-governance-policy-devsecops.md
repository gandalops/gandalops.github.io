# 🛡️ Governance & Policy as Code: My DevSecOps Operating System

In the world of DevSecOps, **Governance** isn’t just a checkbox — it’s the silent force behind security, compliance, and sustainable automation. While many engineers focus on automating infrastructure or deploying pipelines, I wanted to go a step further and **govern myself like an enterprise would govern its cloud**.

This blog post explores my **self-imposed rules**, learning path, and a framework that governs how I build, deploy, and maintain infrastructure — and how I turned that mindset into my own **DevSecOps Operating System**.

## 🌐 The 5 Pillars of DevSecOps

I see modern DevSecOps as built around five interlinked pillars:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes YAMLs
2. **Pipeline as Code** – Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CI/CD with security gates
3. **Monitoring and Observability** – Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Alerting
4. **Security Automation** – Secrets management, SCA, SAST, SBOM, Trivy
5. **Governance & Policy as Code** – Compliance, policy enforcement, audit logs

While security and automation get a lot of attention, **Governance is the brain** — ensuring everything else aligns with enterprise-level policies and auditable standards.

## 🌟 PART 1: Rules I Defined for Myself (Personal Governance Framework)

To simulate working in an enterprise environment, I defined these rules to guide every project I touch:

### 🔐 Security
- No hardcoded secrets — use Vault or environment variables.
- No public ingress (0.0.0.0/0) except for ports 80/443, and only when justified.

### 🏷️ Tagging
- All resources must include tags: `project`, `owner`, `env`, `cost-center`, `compliance-level`.
- Tag audits every 2 weeks.

### 📜 Policy Enforcement
- All CI/CD pipelines must:
  - Run `tfsec` and `Checkov`
  - Block `terraform apply` on failed policies
  - Include an OPA (Open Policy Agent) stage for policy validation

### 💰 Cost Control
- Restrict EC2 types above `t3.medium` unless whitelisted.
- Auto-destroy idle infra after 7 days.

### 📘️ Documentation & Traceability
- Every repo must include:
  - README.md with architecture, policies applied, and resource overview
  - Policy diagram or `cloudskew` diagram
  - Blog post if learning something non-trivial

## 🧠 PART 2: What You Need to Study & Understand (Governance Lens)

Governance isn’t about memorizing tools — it’s about asking the right questions:

### ✅ Core Topics

| Area                    | What to Understand                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPA & Sentinel          | Rego policy language, use with Terraform/Kubernetes            |
| Static Scanning         | How `tfsec`, `Checkov`, and `TFLint` catch issues early        |
| Remote Backends         | Why S3 + DynamoDB state locking is a must                      |
| Tagging Strategy        | Organizational alignment, cost tracking, owner visibility      |
| Secrets Handling        | Vault, SSM, environment variables, GitHub secrets              |
| CI/CD Enforcement       | Adding `policy-validation` stages in Jenkins or GitHub Actions |
| Cost & Drift Management | Restricting expensive resources, monitoring unapproved changes |

### 🛠️ How I Proved It
- Created OPA policies to block port 22 exposure and enforce tags.
- Integrated `tfsec` and `Checkov` in Jenkins pipelines.
- Set up remote state backend with S3 and DynamoDB for locking.
- Documented every Epic with diagrams, rules enforced, and security risks mitigated.

## 📘️ PART 3: My Personal DevSecOps Governance Charter

```markdown
# 🛡️ Personal DevSecOps Governance Charter

## Purpose
To define a strict and professional approach to building, deploying, and maintaining secure, cost-effective, and auditable infrastructure and applications.

## Categories

### 🔐 Security
- No hardcoded secrets
- Enforce least privilege
- Mandatory ingress port review

### 🏷️ Tagging
- Required on all resources:
  - `project`, `env`, `owner`, `compliance-level`
- Periodic tag audit every 2 weeks

### 🧪 Policy Validation
- Every CI/CD pipeline must:
  - Run `tfsec`
  - Enforce OPA rules
  - Block on policy failure

### 💰 Cost Control
- No EC2 instance > t3.medium without approval
- Idle infra must be auto-terminated after 7 days

### 🗓️ State & Audit
- Use remote state (S3 + DynamoDB)
- `terraform plan` and logs stored in Git

### 📘️ Documentation
- All codebases must have:
  - README.md
  - Architecture diagram (draw.io / cloudskew)
  - Blog if it covers new concepts
```

## ✅ Final Thoughts: Governance as Your DevSecOps Muscle

By governing myself with real-world policies and automating those policies into every project, I don’t just *practice* DevSecOps — I **live it**.

My infrastructure is:

- Auditable
- Secure by design
- Aligned with compliance
- Ready for enterprise-scale projects

This mindset powers my entire DevSecOps journey, across all **21 Epics**.
