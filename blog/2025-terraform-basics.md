This week I began **Epic 8: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**.

In this post, I document:
- âœ… How I installed Terraform CLI on my Linux machine
- âœ… How I created my first `main.tf` file to launch an EC2 instance on AWS
- âœ… How I handled `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` safely
- âœ… Lessons I learned about state file management, `.tfvars`, and remote backends

Iâ€™ll continue adding to this post as I progress through the Epic.
