## 🧠 Why I Chose Terraform

Coming from a project management and academic background, I wanted to *actually build things* — infrastructure included. I chose Terraform because:

- **Declarative Syntax**: Write what you want, not how to get there
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP and more
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Fits perfectly in CI/CD pipelines
- **Community Support**: 1,000+ providers and modules available

## 🛠️ Core Concepts I Learned

### 1. Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals
- **Providers**: The `aws` provider connects Terraform to AWS API
- **Resources**: Building blocks like `aws_instance`, `aws_vpc`
- **State Management**: The critical `.tfstate` file
- **Plan/Apply Cycle**: `terraform plan` → review → `terraform apply`

### 2. AWS Networking Basics
```hcl
# Network Foundation
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-VPC"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 EC2 Deployment Walkthrough

### Step 1: Configure AWS Provider
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"
  
  # Never hardcode credentials!
  # Use environment variables or AWS CLI config
}
```

### Step 2: Create Security Group
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from anywhere"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Restrict this in production!
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Amazon Linux 2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "terraform-key"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_ssh.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-EC2"
  }
}
```

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Symptom | Root Cause | Solution |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| SSH Timeout | Connection refused | Missing Internet Gateway | Added IGW and route table |
| State File Lost | "Resource doesn't exist" errors | Accidental deletion | Configured S3 backend |
| Cost Surprise | Unexpected AWS charges | Left instances running | Added `terraform destroy` to workflow |

## 🔒 Security Lessons

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never commit `.tfvars` files with credentials
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables

2. **Least Privilege**:
   ```hcl
   # Bad
   cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
   
   # Good
   cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.12/32"] # Your IP only
   ```

3. **State Protection**:
   - Enable S3 bucket versioning
   - Use DynamoDB for state locking

## ✅ What's Next

1. **Advanced Terraform**:
   - Modules for reusability
   - Workspaces for environments
   - Sentinel policies for governance

2. **DevSecOps Integration**:
